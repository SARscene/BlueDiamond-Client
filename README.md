#BlueDiamond-Client


##What is BlueDiamond?

BlueDiamond is an offline tool allowing SAR teams to deploy search volunteers during a SAR operation more efficiently by quickly organizing them around the base of operations, collecting location and GIS data as they search, and automatically uploading that data to a centralized operations dashboard.


##Why are you working on this?

The first 30 minutes of a SAR operation are the most important.  
Currently, the first 30 minutes is also when the most information is lost due to poor management of available resources.
BlueDiamond was built to address these 2 issues.
