#BlueDiamond-Client


##What is BlueDiamond?

BlueDiamond is an offline tool allowing SAR teams to deploy search volunteers during a SAR operation more efficiently by quickly organizing them around the base of operations, collecting location and GIS data as they search, and then automatically uploading that data to a centralized operations dashboard.


##Why are you working on this?

The first 30 minutes of a SAR operation are the most important.  
Currently, the first 30 minutes is also when the most information is lost due to poor management of available resources.


##How can I get me some Palettability?

Colour away:
go get github.com/camerondykeman/Palettable


##This thing is terrible.
